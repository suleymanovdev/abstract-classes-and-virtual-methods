abstract classes and virtual methods
====================================

1.  Create an abstract base class Employer with
    pure virtual Print() function. Create three derivatives
    class : President, Manager, Worker. Redefine the function
    Print() to print information corresponding to each type
    employee.
    
2.  Create an abstract base class with a virtual function - area.
    Create derived classes: rectangle, circle,
    right triangle, trapezium with its own functions area.
    To check, define an array of references to the abstract class,
    which are assigned the addresses of various objects.
